# Initial idea:
raster pdf -> high-fidelity html (pdf2htmlEX) -> bionified html
## Issues:
pdf2htmlEX simply encodes ocr data behind raster pdf.
While this makes the pdf/html text selectable, it doesn't help with going bionic.
Detecting font is difficult for non-standard fonts.
<br><br>
# Modified idea:
raster pdf -> bionified raster pdf
<br><br>
# Future Steps:
- add concurrency/parallelism as boldening of words are inherently independent
- robust handling of pages with both horizontal and vertical orientations (currently handles only horizontal text)
  -- maybe OSD per ROI instead of entire page? perhaps both??
- handle colored boldening
<br><br>
### P.S. boldening = bolding. Personally prefer the term boldening :)
